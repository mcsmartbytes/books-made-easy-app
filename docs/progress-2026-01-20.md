## Books Your Way - Deployment & Branding Update

### Summary
Successfully deployed the Books Your Way application to Vercel production after migrating from Supabase to Neon database and updating all branding.

**Production URL:** https://books-your-way.vercel.app

---

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Database Migration (Neon)
- Migrated from Supabase to Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- Updated database connection strings
- Verified build passes with new database configuration

#### 2. Branding Update
Updated all references from "Books Made Easy" to "Books Your Way" across the application:

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/page.tsx` | Landing page branding |
| `src/app/layout.tsx` | Metadata and app title |
| `src/app/login/page.tsx` | Login page header |
| `src/app/signup/page.tsx` | Signup page header |
| `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` | Onboarding flow |
| `src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` | Sidebar branding |
| `src/utils/nativeMileageTracker.ts` | App notifications |
| `src/app/dashboard/sitesense/page.tsx` | SiteSense integration |
| `src/app/dashboard/expense-tracker/page.tsx` | Expense tracker integration |

#### 3. Bug Fixes
- **Dashboard redirect**: Fixed infinite spinner when user not authenticated - now redirects to login page
- **Static HTML override**: Removed `public/index.html` that was overriding Next.js routing
- **Framework detection**: Added `vercel.json` to explicitly set Next.js framework for Vercel deployment

#### 4. Vercel Deployment
- Linked project to `books-your-way` Vercel project
- Fixed NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable for production
- Successfully deployed to production

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

| Issue | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Site showing spinner with old branding | `public/index.html` overriding Next.js | Deleted static file |
| 404 on production URL | Vercel not detecting Next.js framework | Added `vercel.json` with `"framework": "nextjs"` |
| Dashboard infinite loading | No redirect for unauthenticated users | Added auth check and redirect to `/login` |
| Deployment to wrong project | Multiple similar Vercel projects | Re-linked with `vercel link --project books-your-way` |
